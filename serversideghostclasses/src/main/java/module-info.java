    /*
        To easily mirror serverside values onto clientside values without needing to unicast them over the internet,
        instead I create a "ghost" hierarchy which keeps the core classes secure and the non-core classes, insecure.
        The only downside to this is the lack of parameterized constructors but who gives a crap. That stuff be specified anyways. A lil overhead code ain hurt nuffin
